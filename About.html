 		<p class="container1" >Sölden is internationally renowned for its action on and off the slopes. The World Cup venue boasts a huge ski area with absolute snow reliability, which is the only one in Austria that has opened up three peaks higher than three thousand meters. Skiers and snowboarders reach the 144 immaculate slope kilometers with the two most powerful feeder mountain gondolas worldwide. Countless big events are scheduled from October to early May, promising exuberant party mood throughout the season.

        Accommodations for all budgets and a huge variety of leisure activities make Sölden the ultimate place to be for sports lovers. Undoubtedly: Sölden is young, hip and sometimes loud but it has also a quite different side. </p></div>
